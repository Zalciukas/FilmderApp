        You are generating content for a movie-guessing game.

        RANDOMIZATION SEED: {randomSeed}
        TARGET ERA: {targetEra}
        TARGET GENRE: {targetGenre}

        THE GAME:
        1. Show the player an emoji sequence that represents a real movie.
        2. Give them four answer options (1 correct, 3 incorrect).

        YOUR TASK:
        - Pick a movie from the {targetEra} era in the {targetGenre} genre
        - The movie MUST match the requested difficulty level
        - Create an emoji sequence with at least 8 emojis that hints at the movie
        - Create 3 incorrect options that are plausible but NOT from the same franchise
        - Output ONLY valid JSON
        - NEVER repeat the same movies - use the randomization seed to ensure variety

        CRITICAL VARIETY RULES:
        - Based on seed {randomSeed}, you MUST choose different movies each time
        - If seed ends in 0-1: Pick movies about RELATIONSHIPS or EMOTIONS
        - If seed ends in 2-3: Pick movies about TECHNOLOGY or FUTURE
        - If seed ends in 4-5: Pick movies about CRIME or MYSTERY
        - If seed ends in 6-7: Pick movies about ADVENTURE or EXPLORATION
        - If seed ends in 8-9: Pick movies about COMEDY or ABSURDITY

        BANNED MOVIES (overused - DO NOT USE):
        {bannedMovies}

        DIFFICULTY DEFINITIONS (VERY IMPORTANT):
        - EASY: (EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GUESS BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY)
          - Choose extremely popular, mainstream movies from {targetEra}
          - Examples: Pixar films, major Disney releases, huge blockbusters
          - Movies that broke box office records or won major Oscars
          - Films everyone has heard of even if they haven't seen them
          - Emoji should be obvious and easy to decode
          - Wrong options should be clearly different from the right movie

        - MEDIUM: (NOT EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GUESS BUT IT'S MANAGABLE)
          - Choose well-known but not ultra-mainstream movies from {targetEra}
          - Movies with a dedicated fan base, Oscar nominees, cult classics
          - Films that were successful but not necessarily #1 box office
          - Emoji sequence should require some thinking but still solvable
          - Wrong options should be believable and from related genres

        - HARD: (ONLY REAL MOVIE FANS CAN GUESS RIGHT)
          - Choose critically acclaimed but less mainstream movies from {targetEra}
          - Indie darlings, international cinema, art house films
          - Movies film buffs love but casual viewers might not know
          - Emoji sequence should be clever and indirect
          - Wrong options must be very convincing alternatives (same era/tone)

        - For HARD: emojis should be abstract and require deep knowledge

            ""Wrong option 3 (different movie, same era/genre)""
          ]
        }}

        OUTPUT RULES (ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED):
        - CORRECT MOVIE TITLE SHOULD BE IN RANDOM SPOTS NOT ONLY IN THE FIRST ONE.
        - Output ONLY valid JSON
        - Do NOT wrap JSON in ``` or ```json
        - No markdown
        - No extra text before or after the JSON
        - No explanations
        - No comments
        - Movie title should include year in parentheses
        - Emoji string should be 8-12 emojis, no spaces between them

        Game 3: Spider-Man

    USER'S QUIZ ANSWERS:
    {answersText}

    DIVERSITY SEED: {diversitySeed}
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHARACTER SELECTION:
    1. You MUST choose characters from DIFFERENT movies/shows - NO repeats from the same franchise
    2. You MUST vary character types - mix protagonists, antagonists, side characters, anti-heroes
    3. You MUST consider the DIVERSITY SEED ({diversitySeed}) to ensure different results each time
    4. PRIORITIZE lesser-known but meaningful character matches over obvious popular choices
    5. Focus on characters from movies/shows released in the last 30 years (1995-2025)
    6. Avoid using the same characters repeatedly - be creative and explore different films
    7. You MUST return EXACTLY 5 character matches

    IMPORTANT VARIETY RULES: (Focus, but if character matches from different category make sure to give it.)
    - If seed is 0-20: Focus on DRAMATIC/INTENSE characters from dramas, thrillers
    - If seed is 21-40: Focus on COMEDIC/LIGHTHEARTED characters from comedies, rom-coms  
    - If seed is 41-60: Focus on ACTION/ADVENTURE characters from action, sci-fi, fantasy
    - If seed is 61-80: Focus on COMPLEX/NUANCED characters from indie films, character studies
    - If seed is 81-100: Focus on ICONIC/LEGENDARY characters from classic and modern cinema

    BANNED CHARACTERS (overused - DO NOT USE):
    - Tony Stark / Iron Man
    - Elle Woods
    - Any character from Marvel Cinematic Universe (unless extremely fitting)
    - Characters from Game of Thrones (unless extremely fitting)

    YOUR TASK:
    1. Analyze the personality traits revealed by these answers
    2. Match the user to exactly 5 movie or TV series characters
    3. Ensure ALL 5 characters are from COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movies/shows/franchises
    4. Calculate a match percentage (60-99%) for each character - make them meaningful differences
    5. Provide a brief explanation for each match that references SPECIFIC quiz answers
    6. Find real image URLs for each character from TMDB or IMDb
    7. Create a short personality profile summary

    MATCHING CRITERIA:
    - Consider values, decision-making style, social preferences, conflict handling, life outlook
    - Choose characters that would resonate with THIS SPECIFIC user based on their answers
    - Match percentages should reflect genuine compatibility (don't just give 95%+ to everyone)
    - First match: 88-95% (best fit)
    - Second match: 82-88% (very strong fit)  
    - Third match: 75-82% (strong fit)
    - Fourth match: 68-75% (good fit with some differences)
    - Fifth match: 60-68% (decent fit but notable differences)

    IMAGE URL REQUIREMENTS:
    - Provide REAL working image URLs for each character
    - Use high-quality images from TMDB: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/[path]

    - If no real URL available, use: https://via.placeholder.com/300x450?text=[CharacterName]

    EXAMPLE OF GOOD DIVERSE MATCHES (5 characters from 5 different movies):
    ❌ BAD (all superheroes): Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hulk
    ✅ GOOD (varied): Amélie (Amélie), Mark Zuckerberg (The Social Network), Luna Lovegood (Harry Potter), Joel (Eternal Sunshine), Mia (La La Land)

    ❌ BAD (all from same franchise): Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, Yoda
